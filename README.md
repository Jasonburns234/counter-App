# Count and Save App

This is a simple web application that allows you to increment a counter and save its value along with a valueStamp. The saved entries are displayed below the counter.

## Demo

You can see the live demo of the application hosted on Netlify: [Count and Save App Demo] (https://roaring-malasada-0833b0.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- Click the "increment" button to increment the counter displayed on the screen.
- Click the "Save" button to save the current counter value.
- Saved entries are displayed below the counter.

## Code Explanation

1. The `index.html` file contains the structure of the web page, including the counter element and the area to display saved entries.
2. The JavaScript code in `script.js` file handles the functionality of the application.
   - The `increment` function increments the counter and updates its display.
   - The `save` function saves the current counter value with a timestamp and displays it in the list of saved entries.
